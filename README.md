## process

Commit 1: Initial Commit
    Folder and repository created

Commit 2: homework base files
    I copied the html and assists folder into my project folder and pushed them to github

Commit 3: changed semantic html elements
    First I read up on semantic elements and determined which would be appropriate for the various elements included in the webpage. 
    I replaced the divs with semantic elements and updated the styling to apply to these elements rather than the various classes.
    In many cases these classes could simply be combined into one styling that applied to multiple sections, and doing so greatly tided up the css file.

Commit 4: added title and improved the structure of the code
    Changed title from 'website' to 'Horiseon'. I will likely change this again later to add a description, but it just saying 'website' was annoying me.
    I researched into proper structure and then went through my code to have it better align with generally accepted structure and also to make it easier to digest, as cluttered code can mess with my adhd. 

Commit 5: added img alt text
    I realized that, as I am new to coding, it may be a good idea to take notes in regards to everything I do. As such, I began working on my README, which you are currently reading. 
    Before adding alt text, I realized that I needed to change the hero image so that it was not a background image. 
    I like many others struggled with the image wanting to take up the full page and then being distorted when the right size. 
    Taking another look at the original code, I realized it, as a bg image, was being cropped, and looked in to how to do that with regular images.
    After it worked perfectly, I shared what had led me to my solution in hopes the others would find it helpful as well!
    Once that was settled, I added alt text to all my images.
